# phishing-mail-examples

These are phishing mail examples found in the wild for educational purposes.

For privacy reasons, names of people and organizations will be changed to this:

- Targeted Company: Target-Example; target.example.com
- Targeted Person: John Doe; john.doe@target.example.com
- Attacker Domain: attacker.example.com
- Attacker Mail Address: attack@attacker.example.com
- IP Addresses: 192.0.2.1
- Mail Provider Domains of Attacker: mail.example.com

Most mail headers will also be redacted like Received and so on.

Attachments will be removed from the e-mail and put as files in the respective folder. All scripts and personal data will be scraped, so that it's not possible to provide data to the attackers accidentally.
